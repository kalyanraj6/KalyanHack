Knowing many people from different countries and cultures, being able to gain confidence with them and many other things, makes the Hackathon a unique experience. The competition requires some sacrifices but, at the end, the benefits are bigger. If you need a 'mentor' in future competitions I will be always glad to help.<span class="fa fa-quote-right right"></span></p>
